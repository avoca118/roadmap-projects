# Roadmap.sh Projects

This repository contains my completed frontend practice projects from **roadmap.sh**.  
Each project focuses on core frontend concepts such as semantic HTML, accessibility, layout, responsiveness, and CSS styling.

All projects are organized into individual folders, each with its own `README.md` explaining the goal and implementation.
