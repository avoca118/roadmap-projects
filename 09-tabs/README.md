# Simple Tabs Project

This project demonstrates **basic DOM manipulation** and **event handling** in JavaScript. It is designed to help beginners practice selecting elements, listening for click events, and dynamically updating content on a web page.

## Project Overview

The page consists of **four tabs**, with the first tab active by default. When a user clicks on another tab:

- The currently visible tab content is hidden.
- The clicked tab's content is displayed.
- The active tab is visually highlighted.

This project helps you understand how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript and respond to user interactions.

## Features

- Fully functional **tab switching**.
- **Active tab highlighting** for better user experience.
- Clean, responsive **HTML/CSS layout**.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** implementation (no libraries required).
