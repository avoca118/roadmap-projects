# Tooltip UI

A simple and elegant **Tooltip UI** built using only **HTML and CSS**.  
This project demonstrates how to create interactive tooltips that appear above navigation items on hover—without using JavaScript.

## 📌 Project Overview

A tooltip is a small pop-up element that provides additional information when users hover over an interface item.  
In this project, tooltips appear above navigation links such as **Home**, **Projects**, **Blog**, and **Contact**.

The main goal is to practice **CSS positioning**, **pseudo-elements**, and **hover-based interactions** to enhance user experience in a clean and accessible way.
