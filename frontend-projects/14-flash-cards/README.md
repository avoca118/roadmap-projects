# Flash Cards

A simple Flash Cards application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project focuses on displaying questions one at a time, revealing answers on demand, and visually tracking progress as users move through the cards.

📌 Project Overview  
Flash cards are commonly used for learning and memorization by presenting information in small, focused pieces.  
In this project, users can navigate through a set of pre-defined flashcards, flip each card to reveal its answer, and monitor their progress using a progress bar.

The main goal is to practice state management, user interaction, and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript.
