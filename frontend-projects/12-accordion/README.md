# Accordion Component

A simple, interactive accordion component built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project demonstrates how to create a clean and organized UI where only one content section can be expanded at a time.

## 📌 Project Description

The accordion displays a list of questions or headings. When a user clicks on a question, its corresponding answer expands while any previously opened section collapses automatically. This behavior helps keep the interface tidy and improves the user experience.

This project focuses on practicing:

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Toggling UI states
- Building reusable and responsive UI components

## 🎯 Features

- Click to expand or collapse sections
- Only one accordion item opens at a time
- Clean and minimal layout
- Responsive and user-friendly design

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the accordion
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity and logic

- Any other open section closes automatically
