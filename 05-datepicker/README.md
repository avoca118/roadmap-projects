# Date Picker UI Component

A simple **Date Picker UI** built using **HTML and CSS only**.  
This project focuses on layout, positioning, and responsive design — no JavaScript logic is involved.

The goal of this assignment is to practice:

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Absolute positioning
- Clean UI structuring

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **UI-only component**, not a functional date picker.
